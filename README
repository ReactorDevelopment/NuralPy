Requirements: Python 3.8 or higher
Running the main project file is as simple as
"python main.py"
when in the src directory of the project.
By default, this will run the project in the exact configuration that was used in the presentation slides.

Modifying any of the parameters in the dictionaries in the main method will result in different execution behavior.  After each successful execution, the program will output the results of the testing, such as which guesses were correct or incorrect.
The program will also display a plot showing the loss and accuracy over time.

The DecisionTree.py file contains the logic for the decision tree.  Actually running the decision tree is not utilized in the main project, so this can be tested in the main method here.  Through this file, the decision tree can be run and tested for its accuracy.

The TreeNeuralNet.py and Neuron.py files are deprecated.  They are not utilized anywhere in the program and their run configurations were replaced early on in the project.  The active utilization of this section of code can be accessed from early commits from the github repository.
