Shape of hidden layers

There is an article that proposes a method to find out how many neurons should be in a hidden layer. According to Sheela and Deepa (2013) number of neurons can be calculated in a hidden layer as (4*n^2+3)/(n^2-8) where n is the number of input.
On the other hand, number of hidden layer can be 2 in little data set. (0,10) in the large data set that can be adjusted according to the accuracy of MSE etc.
The study is Sheela, K. G., & Deepa, S. N. (2013). Review on methods to fix number of hidden neurons in neural networks. Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2013.
